Mourinho explained: Look, if I have a triangle in midfield – Claude Makélélé behind and two others just in front – I will always have an advantage against a pure 4–4–2 where the central midfielders are side by side. I’m not counting on him right now, but if he did [make it], it would be fantastic for the selection. Upon later reflection, Vilarinho rued his poor judgement and expressed his frustration at losing Mourinho: [Put me] back then [and] I would do exactly the opposite: I would extend his contract. This marked the first time in seven years that Inter managed to make it to the semi-finals of the competition. He became the only coach who has won the national super cups in four European countries. This was Mourinho's first season without a league title win in five years. [185] In all of Mourinho's three seasons at Madrid, the team consistently reached the semi-finals of the Champions League.

On 2 June 2008, Mourinho was appointed the successor of Roberto Mancini at Inter Milan on a three-year contract, and brought along with him much of his backroom staff who had served him at both Chelsea and Porto. In terms of spending, Mourinho carried on where his predecessor Claudio Ranieri left off, as, bankrolled by Roman Abramovich, he spent in excess of £70 million in transfer fees on players such as Tiago (£10 million) from Benfica, Michael Essien (£24.4 million) from Lyon, Didier Drogba (£24 million) from Marseille, Mateja Kežman (£5.4 million) from PSV, and Porto pair Ricardo Carvalho (£19.8 million) and Paulo Ferreira (£13.3 million). [27], The chance to become a top-tier manager arrived in September 2000 when Mourinho moved up from his role as assistant manager at Benfica to replace manager Jupp Heynckes after the fourth week of the Primeira Liga. Later he accepted the position of assistant manager at Estrela da Amadora,[22] then was a scout at Ovarense.

[24] Van Gaal also let Mourinho take charge of the first team (acting as Mourinho's assistant himself) for certain trophies, like the Copa Catalunya, which Mourinho won in 2000. In a 2013–14 Champions League knockout game against Paris Saint-Germain, when Chelsea needed one goal within 10 minutes to progress, he played a risky 4–1–2–3 in the last quarter, which led to Demba Ba's winning goal. Such was Robson's desperation for Mourinho to join him he offered to step down after two years in charge and hand over the reins to Mourinho. [127], Mourinho's first competitive game back in charge of Chelsea ended in a 2–0 home victory against Hull City on 18 August 2013.[128].
