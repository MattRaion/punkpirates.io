Meade missed two survivors from Walke, Seaman Dale E. Land and Machinist’s Mate Harold Taylor. They crippled two freighters, which had to be abandoned, then headed for Guadalcanal. All his cruisers and destroyers had been used up in the Friday 13th battle. Both sides were bringing their favored weapons into this battle. The American destroyers lacked SG radar, night training and cohesion. With Washington Captain Glenn Davis and gunnery officer Lt. Cdr. More important, Fraser’s tin cans took torpedoes Kimura had aimed at Lee’s battleships. For a time it seemed they were trapped, but determined shipmates doused the fires and closed open steam lines. The Americans shattered the convoy, sank two battleships, and put ashore 5,500 men and tons of supplies. He wanted the more-experienced Hunter to stay on the bridge, and Schanze to man the navigating table. Two hundred miles to the north, the Japanese were swinging into action. Hell, [South Dakota] just left the action. The destroyer USS Benham was badly damaged during the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal and later sunk by the destroyer USS Gwin after it was deemed unsalvageable. Kondo’s plan was simple–blast through Guadalcanal and pummel the airfield. All morning Taylor nursed his ship toward home, but by midafternoon, it was too much. Takao sighted Washington, and Atago‘s lookout said the enemy vessel ‘looked like a battleship.’ Kondo disagreed, but now he figured it was time to shell the airfield. Washington found Ayanami and shelled her. Call off your boys!’ Lee’s temper did the job. He was described as an ‘English sort of officer,’ very gentlemanly, and good with his staff, but better suited for training command than battle. The firing solution was sent to the guns, but just as the firing circuits were to be closed, Walsh yelled, ‘Check fire!’. Yamamoto was now taking the offensive, and his battleships and destroyers were a powerful force. At 10:31, Atago, Kondo’s flagship, picked up the enemy. In preparation for the convoy, the Japanese Navy moves in to bombard Henderson Field. After that, Meade pulled 266 Walke and Preston survivors out of the drink. Some Japanese shells did find their mark. But there was no time to think about those issues just then. Ayanami sank sometime after 2 a.m. after two explosions. The multiphase Naval Battle of Guadalcanal consisted of a series of air and sea engagements related to the Japanese effort to reinforce their land forces on Guadalcanal in order to seize or destroy Henderson Field. Kondo and his staff trained binoculars and studied the battleship’s distinctive pyramid foremast. He figured nothing could be gained from attacking the transports now. Yamamoto was now taking the offensive, and his battleships and destroyer… Lee planned to head north and attack the transports. Lots of gameplay videos on Youtube. Lee was astounded at the request and refused. The toll of Marines dead on the three islands was 144; the wounded numbered 194. Two transports were sunk and a third was sent home badly damaged. Then Lee’s destroyers raced in to attack. At 4 a.m., four transports ran aground. At 11:17 Washington‘s bridge ordered, ‘Open fire when ready.’ The ship’s electric bells rang twice, and blinding tongues of flame shot out of the main guns. No hits. At noon on November 17, general quarters sounded for entering Noumea and Washington moored at 2:20 p.m. in nine fathoms of water at the end of 360 feet of anchor chain. Eleven months after witnessing the attack on Pearl Harbor, Harold Ward stood watch aboard the USS San Francisco as the heavy cruiser "steamed right into a mess." Harold Ward: The Naval Battle of Guadalcanal. Lee swung in to attack, his ships racing by blazing hulks and shipwrecked crewmen floating in oily water. Uranami lookouts had them in sight, too, and identified them as ‘new-type cruisers.’ Hashimoto took his ships clockwise around Savo, with one destroyer, Ayanami, heading counterclockwise to sweep for enemy vessels. When it came back on, it picked up Kondo forward of her starboard beam just three miles away. Kondo was steaming south to meet the light cruiser Sendai. At 11 p.m., Washington‘s radar located a target bearing 340 true, broad on the starboard bow, 18,000 yards away. The US Navy sent two new battleships the Washington and the South Dakota with nine destroyers. Commanding the two battlewagons was Rear Adm. Willis A. In any case, he had delayed the Japanese so long that the transports would have to arrive by daylight, when American air power could savage them. At 12:10 a.m., those two ships swept in on Guadalcanal. Down in the engine room, Johnny Brown broke out a jug that normally stored anti-corrosive gas compounds. To the north, Kondo decided he had had enough. He had been convinced that South Dakota was being sunk and was alone. The ship looped to escape gunfire, then staggered back in to action at 10 knots. Over the next four days, in hard fighting at sea and in the air, the opposing navies suffered severely. Lee wrote later that the effect of the shelling was to ‘render one of our new battleships deaf, dumb, blind and impotent.’.
