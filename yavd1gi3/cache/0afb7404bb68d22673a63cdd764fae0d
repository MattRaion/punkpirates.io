An ingenious yet simple way to calculate the day of the week for any date was invented by John Conway called the Doomsday rule.I highly recommend reading the article by S.W. The usual formula described to make this calculation can be written as. doomsday.py: a Doomsday rule trainer Overview. Step 4: Move from the doomsday to the date in question. Here's how to do it in four steps: In Conway's concept, each weekday is represented by a number: Memorize these numbers before moving on. It is easy to work out any other year in the twentieth or twenty-first centuries by taking the whole number part of (year - 1900)/12 then dividing the remainder by 4, adding the whole number part of the result of this division and the remainder of the second division. For January you can work back from February so that Doomsday is January 31st and so also is the 3rd, except in leap years where it moves forward to January 4th. Different rules apply to the Julian calendar. How to Mentally Calculate the Day of the Week for Any Date. To determine the doomsday of the year in question, you have to follow a series of 6 simple calculations. It provides a perpetual calendar because the Gregorian calendar moves in cycles of 400 years. For the odd months you need a mnemonic: On the 9th month Doomsday is on the 5th and on the 5th month Doomsday is on the 9th (remember 9 to 5). On the 7th month Doomsday is on the 11th and on the 11th month Doomsday is on the 7th (remember 7-Eleven). With this device you can discover what day of the week it was or will be for any date between 1901 and 2099. The Doomsday rule or Doomsday algorithm is a relatively simple way to calculate the day of the week of a given date. I highly recommend reading the article by S.W. Find the doomsday of the year using the doomsday algorithm. Doomsday may refer to a hypothetical event according to which the end of human life is at the highest possibility. A simple command line utility implemented in Python for practicing mental calculation of the day of the week for dates in the Gregorian calendar, using the Doomsday rule algorithm originally described by John Horton Conway [1]. The best thing about the doomsday algorithm: your friends will think you have a superhuman memory, when all you need to do is memorize a set of numbers and do a series of simple calculations. Enter the date to calculate. In the example date of February 11, 1978, the closest doomsday is the last day of February, which was February 28 because 1978 was not a leap year. ; If you need to floor divide and get the remainder use divmod. Grahamwhich fully describes the algorithm. Your code is hard to understand, even after watching the video. Learn more about numerically unique calendar dates such as sequential dates, same number dates, and palindrome (reversible) dates, © Time and Date AS 1995–2021. This might sound awfully complicated at first, and most of us will need a good minute or three to go through all the steps. Determine the "anchor day" for the century. This involves first finding an anchor day for the century, then using the last two digits of the century to find the number of days (x) that the anchor day must be shifted by to determine the doomsday for the year. In order to do the Doomsday algorithm for any year in the 1900's, when most of us were born, we need to memorize the fact that Doomsday for 1900 is Wednesday.  It was devised by John Conway, drawing inspiration from Lewis Carroll’s work on a perpetual calendar algorithm. This table cycles every 28 years, except in the Gregorian calendar on years multiple of 100 (like 1900 which is not a leap year) that are not multiple of 400 (like 2000 which is still a leap year). So April 4th is a Doomsday, as is June 6th, August 8th, October 10th and December 12th. Determine the "anchor day" for the century. Subtract whole multiples of 7 from the result of calculation 5. Use this device to quickly find the day of the week for any date between 1901 and 2099. years_doomsday would help move some of the hard to understand information to be self-contained. What's a Doomsday, though? The Doomsday rule is an algorithm of determination of the day of the week for a given date. Once you know the Doomsday for the year, you can work out the day of the week for any date by the following rules: For February, simply work back from the Doomsday by subtraction, so for example if Doomsday is a Wednesday and it is a non-leap year, then February 27th is Tuesday, February 21st is a Wednesday, as is the 14th and the 7th, and so on. When advancing a century from a century you know the Doomsday for, go back two days, unless the new century is divisible by 400, in which case only go back one day B. Then we do a calculation based on the number of years since 1900. The Doomsday Algorithm or Doomsday Rule is technique which always you to determine what day of the week a future date will be in seconds. It was devised by John Conway, drawing inspiration from Lewis Carroll’s work on a perpetual calendar algorithm. This will result in a number between 0 and 6, which corresponds to the doomsday of the year. Conway's algorithm bases on the fact that some dates always fall on the same weekday within any given year. But then again, he's a math professor. Some dates fall on the same weekday every year. The Doomsday Algorithm is often used with people's birthdays. Doomsday in this context does not refer to world catastrophe, but rather to particular dates in any given year which always fal. C. Choose the closest date out of The Doomsday Algorithm is often used with people's birthdays. Since there are … Calendars repeat themselves every 400 years, so all you need to do is to remember the anchor days for 4 centuries. The difference between 72 and 78 is 6, so the result is, Example: The result of calculation 2 was 6. The name may sound a little odd, but the algorithm is amazing: It allows you to calculate the day of the week for any given date in your head. Instead of doing this computation in your head, you’re going to implement a Doomsday calculator that can compute the day for any date in the 1990s. What Day Is Doomsday? To find the day of the week for a date in history, or the future, the key is to know the Doomsday for the given year. int(y/12) + y mod 12 + int((y mod 12)/4) where y is the last two digits of the year. In order to do the Doomsday algorithm for any year in the 1900's, when most of us were born, we need to memorize the fact that Doomsday for 1900 is Wednesday. Graham which fully describes the algorithm. The Doomsday rule or Doomsday algorithm is a way of calculating the day of the week of a given date. Make some functions. later at the modiﬁcation needed to calculate dates on the Julian calendar. Use the Weekday Calculator to find out the weekday for any date. It takes advantage of each year having a certain day of the week upon which certain easy-to-remember dates, called the doomsdays, fall; for example, the last day of Febru Applying doomsday algorithm; How to calculate doomsday of the year; Calculate a given date; Download sample C file; What is doomsday?

Doomsday for the current year in the Gregorian calendar (2015) is Saturday. The following table summarizes which integers represent weekdays an… What is doomsday? The Doomsday Algorithm was developed over the course of many years by John Horton Conway, a renowned mathematics professor at Princeton University, who took up day-of-the-week calculation as a hobby. The so-called doomsday algorithm uses clever mental arithmetic and … For example on which day of the week were you born? 1. There are many algorithms written to calculate which day of a week in a year has the highest possibility of doomsday falling on that day. Don't want to do the math? Don't forget: even the inventor of the doomsday rule is said to practice these calculations every day to perfect his speed-calculating skills. Month: / Day: / Year: Start. Closest Doomsday = Jan. 3 (since 1900 isn’t a leap year), so January 30 (27 = 28 – 1 days later) was a Tuesday. To illustrate the calculations, an example is given for each - let's say we want to find out which day of the week February 11, 1978 fell on... Now it is only a small step to the final result. For even months, the nth of the month is a Doomsday. BUT the algorithm also must be able to calculate days, which are in the future. In 1970, British mathematician John Conway devised a way to quickly calculate the weekday of any given date without the help of calculators, computers, or calendars The usual formula described to make this calculation can be written as. The full cycle is 28 years (1,461 weeks) in the Julian calendar, 400 years (20,871 weeks) in the Gregorian calendar. Applying doomsday algorithm; How to calculate doomsday of the year; Calculate a given date; Download sample C file; What is doomsday? The name may sound a little odd, but the algorithm is amazing: It allows you to calculate the day of the week for any given date in your head. At the time that he taught me the algorithm, he could calculate the day of the week in his head for ANY date on the Gregorian calendar in 3 seconds flat. The rule breaks down at the year 2100 because it is not a leap year. The number 12 fits 6 whole times into 78 (6 x 12 = 72), so the result is, Example: The product of 6 x 12 is 72 (see calculation 1). Now I need an algorithm which has the parameters int year, int month, int day and calculates the name of the day which was at the 10.5.2010. With this device you can discover what day of the week it was or will be for any date between 1901 and 2099. Once you know the Doomsday for a given month you can get any other day in that month by simple adding or subtracting. For the twenty-first century you can save effort if you know that Doomsday 2000 is a Tuesday and work forward from there (remember as the year "Tue thousand"). According to some sources, Conway can now usually give a correct answer in under two seconds. Conway delights in asking new acquaintances their birthdates and almost instantaneously telling them on which day of the week they were born; he claims (perhaps not unreasonably) to be the fastest human date-calculator in the world. Doomsday Day of the Week Calculator Use this device to quickly find the day of the week for any date between 1901 and 2099. Note: The rules described here apply only to the Gregorian calendar (“Western calendar”). Example: 16 - 14 = 2, so the result is 2.
